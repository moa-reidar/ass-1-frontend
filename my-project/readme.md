# Star Wars API Viewer

## Project Description

The **Star Wars API Viewer** is a web application that allows users to view detailed information about various elements from the Star Wars universe, such as films, characters (people), planets, and vehicles. The data is fetched from the Star Wars API and displayed in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

The purpose of this project is to showcase how to interact with an external API, dynamically load data, and present it in a structured layout with basic styling. It is built using **JavaScript** for the functionality and **CSS** for the layout.

## Project Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/moa-reidar/ass-1-frontend.git
   

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   cd ass-1-frontend
   

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   
   npm install
   

4. Start the development server:

   npm run dev
   

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:(some number)/` to see the application in action.


## Usage Instructions

To use this application, simply open it in a browser. The website will display buttons that allow you to view different categories such as **Films**, **People**, **Planets**, and **Vehicles**. Clicking on any of these buttons will fetch the respective data from the Star Wars API and display it in a neat, responsive grid layout.

### Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts automatically for different screen sizes, providing a good experience on both desktops and mobile devices.
- **API Integration**: Dynamically loads data from the Star Wars API, including films, people, planets, and vehicles.
- **Data Display**: Displays relevant data such as title, director, release date, and more, along with images for each entity.
- **Navigation**: Simple button-based navigation to switch between different data views.
